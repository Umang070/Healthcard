# Healthcard

The Project's key objective to make digital health card is to solve current scenarios of the healthcare system in our society. 

The health card contains the past medical history of the patient. With the help of the information stored in the health card and by accumulating all the health card's data in one centralized datastore the administration can track and do an analysis of particular areas and find out which disease is the most widespread so that they can be able to take appropriate steps to eliminate that problem.

This project removes the requirement for physical description as well as reduces the manual work of keeping past medical data in files. As a result, a patient just has to give his/her unique health ID in authorized laboratories and pharmacies to get medicines and reports. 

There is one admin panel in our project which approves and stores only authorized doctors, hospitals, laboratories, and pharmacies based on their license.
